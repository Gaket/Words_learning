I've seen the world 
Done it all 
Had my cake now 
Diamonds, brilliant 
In Bel-Air now 
Hot summer nights, mid july 
When you and i were forever wild 
The crazy days, city lights 
The way you'd play with me like a child 

Will you still love me 
When i'm no longer young and beautiful? 
Will you still love me 
When i've got nothing but my aching soul? 
I know you will, i know you will 
I know that you will 
Will you still love me when i'm no longer beautiful? 


I've seen the world, lit it up 
As my stage now 
Changeling angels in a new age now 
Hot summer days, rock n roll 
The way you play for me at your show 
And all the ways i got to know 
Your pretty face and electric soul 

Will you still love me 
When i'm no longer young and beautiful? 
Will you still love me 
When i've got nothing but my aching soul? 
I know you will, i know you will 
I know that you will 
Will you still love me when i'm no longer beautiful? 


Dear lord, when i get to heaven 
Please let me bring my man 
When he comes tell me that you'll let him 
Father tell me if you can 
All that grace, all that body 
All that face, makes me wanna party 
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds 

And will you still love me 
When i'm no longer young and beautiful? 
Will you still love me 
When i've got nothing but my aching soul? 
I know you will, i know you will 
I know that you will 
Will you still love me when i'm no longer beautiful? 
Will you still love me when i'm no longer beautiful? 
Will you still love me when i'm not young and beautiful?
