I love those J-I-N-G-L-E bells 
Those holiday J-I-N-G-L-E bells 
Those happy J-I-N-G-L-E B-E, double-L-S 
I love those J-I-N-G-L-E bells 


Jingle bells, jingle bells 
Jingle all the way 
Oh, what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh, oh 


Jingle bells, jingle bells 
Jingle all the way 
Oh, what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh 


Dashing through the snow 
In a one-horse open sleigh 
O'er the fields we go 
Laughing all the way 


Bells on bob-tail ring 
Making our spirits bright 
What fun it is to ride and sing 
A sleighing song tonight 


Jingle bells, jing-jingle bells 
Jingle all the way 
Oh, what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh 


I love those J-I-N-G-L-E bells 
Those holiday J-I-N-G-L-E bells 
Those happy J-I-N-G-L-E B-E, double-L-S 
I love those jingle bells all the way
