You know that I'm a crazy bitch 
I do what I want when I feel like it 
All I wanna do is lose control 
But you don't really give a shit 
you don't let it go let it go with it 
'cause you're fucking crazy rock'n'roll 


[Bridge] 
You said "Hey, 
What's your name?" 
it took one look 
and now I'm not the same 
Yeah you said "Hey." 
and since that day 
you stole my heart 
and you're the one to blame 


[Chorus] 
Yeah 
and that's why I smile 
It's been a while 
since every day and everything has 
felt this right 
and now you're turning all around 
and suddenly you're all I need 
The reason why I smile 


Last night I blacked out I think 
What did you, what did you put in my drink? 
I remember making out and then, oh, oh 
I woke up with a new tattoo 
your name was on me and my name was on you 
I will do it all over again 


[Bridge] 


[Chorus] 


You know that I'm a crazy bitch 
I do what I want when I feel like it 
All I wanna do is lose control 
You know that I'm a crazy bitch 
I do what I want when I feel like it 
All I wanna do is lose control
