If i didn't have you, life would be blue 
I'd be Doctor Who wothout the Tardis 
A candle without a wick, Watson without a crick 
I'd be one of my outfits without a dickey 


I'd be cheese without the mac 
Steve Jobs without the Wozniak 
I'd be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator,making it much harder to crack 


I'd be an atom without a bomb, a dot without the com 
And i'd probably still live with my mom 
(All: And he'd probably still live with his mom) 


Ever since i met you, you're turned my world around 
You've supported all my dreams and all my hopes 
You're like Uranium-235 and i'm Uranium-238, 
Almost inseparable isotopes 


I couldn't have imagined how good my life would get 
From the moment that i met you, Bernadette 


If i din't have you, life would be dreary 
I'd be string theory without any string 
I'd be binary code without a one, 
A cathode ray without an electron gun 
I'd be "Firefly","Buffy" and "Avengers" without Joss Whedon 
I'd speak a lot of Klingon 
(Speaks Klingon - Today it's a good day to die) 
All: And he'd definitely still live with his mom 


Ever since i met you, you've turned my world around 
You're my best friend and my lover 
We're like changing electric and magnetic fields, you can't have one,without the other 


I couldn't have imagined how good my life would get 
From the moment that i met you, Bernadette 


All: We couldn't have imagined, how good our lives would get 
From the moment that we met you, Bernadette
