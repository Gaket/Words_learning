In the middle of the night, 
When the angels scream, 
I do want to live a life I believe. 
Time to do or die! 


I will never forget the moment, the moment. 
I will never forget the moment... 


And the story goes on 
Oon... 
Oon... 
That's how the story goes... 
That's how the story goes... 


You and I will never die 
It's a dark embrace. 
In the beginning was a life, a dawning age 
Time to be alive. 


I will never forget the moment, the moment. 
I will never forget this night, 
We'll sing. 
We'll sing. 


Oon... 
Oon... 
Oon... 
That's how the story goes... 


Fate is coming down, that I know. 
Time is running, got to go... 
Fate is coming down, that I know. 
Let it go... 


Hear me now 
Under the banner of heaven 
Dream out loud. 


Do or die! 
And the story goes 
Oon... 
Oon... 
Oon... 


And the story goes 
Oon... 
Oon... 
Oon... 


(This is the story...) 
Fate is coming down, that I know. 
(This is the story...) 
Time is running, got to go... 
(This is the story...) 
Fate is coming down, that I know. 
(This is the story...) 
Let it go... 


Hear me now 
Under the banner of heaven 
Dream out loud. 
Dream out loud. 


Fate is coming down, that I know. 
(Time to do or die) 
Time is running, got to go... 
(Time to do or die) 
Fate is coming down, that I know. 
(Time to do or die) 


Let it go...
