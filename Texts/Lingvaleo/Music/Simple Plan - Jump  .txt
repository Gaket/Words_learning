I dont wanna wake up today 
Cuz every days the same 
And Ive been waiting so long 
For things to change 


Im sick of this town 
Sick of my job 
Sick of my friends cuz everyones jaded 
Sick of this place 
I wanna break free 
Im so frustrated 


I just wanna jump (jump) 
Dont wanna think about tomorrow (jump) 
I just dont care tonight 
I just wanna jump (jump) 
Dont wanna think about my sorrow 
Lets go whoa 
Forget your problems 
I just wanna jump 


I dont wanna wake up one day 
And find out its too late 
To do all the things I wanna do 
So Im gonna pack up my bags 
Im never comin back 
Cuz the years are passin by 
And I'm wasting all my t-t-time 


Im sick of this house 
Sick of bein broke 
Sick of this town thats bringin me down 
Im Sick of this place 
I wanna break free 
Im so frustrated 


I just wanna jump (jump) 
Dont wanna think about tomorrow (jump) 
I just dont care tonight 
I just wanna jump (jump) 
Dont wanna think about my sorrow 
Lets go woah 
Forget your problems 
I just wanna jump 


I just wanna jump 


I cant take it anymore 
I cant take it anymore 
I cant take it anymore 
Cant take it any 
Cant take it any 
Cant take it (take it anymore) 
Forget tomorrow 


I just wanna jump (jump) 
Dont wanna think about tomorrow (jump) 
I just dont care tonight 
I just wanna jump (jump) 
Dont wanna think about my sorrow 
Lets go whoa 
Forget your problems 
I just let them go whoa 
Forget tomorrow 
I just wanna jump (jump)
