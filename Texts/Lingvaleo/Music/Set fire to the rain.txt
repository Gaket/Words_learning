I let it fall, my heart 
And as it fell you rose to claim it 
It was dark and I was over 
Until you kissed m lips and you saved me 


My hands, they were strong 
But my knees were far too weak 
To stand in your arms 
Without falling to your feet 


But there's a side to you 
That I never knew, never knew 
All the things you'd say 
They were never true, never true 
And the games you'd play 
You would always win, always win 


But I set fire to the rain 
Watched it pour as I touched your face 
Let it burn while I cry 
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name 


When laying with you 
I could stay there, close my eyes 
Feel you here forever 
You and me, together, nothing gets better 


'Cause there's a side to you 
That I never knew, never knew 
All the things you'd say 
They were never true, never true 
And the games you'd play 
You would always win, always win 


But I set fire to the rain 
Watched it pour as I touched your face 
Let it burn while I cry 
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name 


I set fire to the rain 
And I threw us into the flames 
I felt something die 
'Cause I knew that that was the last time 
The last time 


Sometimes, I woke up by the door 
And heard you calling, must be waiting for you 
Even now when we're already over 
I can't help myself from looking for you 


I set fire to the rain 
Watched it pour as I touched your face 
Let it burn while I cry 
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name 


I set fire to the rain 
And I threw us into the flames 
I felt something die 
'Cause I knew that that was the last time 
The last time 


Let it burn 
Let it burn
