Here's a little song i wrote, 
You might want to sing it note for note, 
Don't worry, be happy 


In every life we have some trouble, 
When you worry you make it double 
Don't worry, be happy 


Don't worry be happy now 
Don't worry be happy 
Don't worry be happy 
Don't worry be happy 
Don't worry be happy 
Ain't got no place to lay your head, 
Somebody came and took your bed, 
Don't worry, be happy 


The landlord say your rent is late, 
He may have to litagate, 
Don't worry (small laugh) be happy, 

Look at me im happy, 
Don't worry, be happy 


i give you my phone number, 
When your worried, call me, 
I make you happy 


Don't worry, be happy 


Ain't got no cash, aint got no style, 
Ain't got no gal to make you smile 
But don't worry, be happy 


Because when you worry, your face will frown, 
And that will bring everybody down, 
So don't worry, be happy 


Don't worry, be happy now... 


Don't worry, be happy 
Don't worry, be happy 
Don't worry, be happy 
Don't worry, be happy 


Don't worry be happy 


Don't worry be happy 
Be happy now 


Don't worry, be happy 
Don't worry, be happy 
Don't worry, be happy 
Don't worry, be happy 
Don't worry 
Don't worry be happy 
Don't worry, don't worry, don't do it, 
Be happy,put a smile on your face, 
Don't bring everybody down like this 


Don't worry, it will soon pass whatever it is, 
Do not worry ,be happy, 
I am not worry ,i am happy
