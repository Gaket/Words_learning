Suddenly I'm famous, 
and people know my name. 
I've got a thousand girls just waiting, 
and therefore it's a shame 
that my heart has been captured 
by your funny little smile. 
And finally I'm happy, 
if only for a while. 


People call me stupid, 
for treating you like a queen. 
But I don't even worry, 
'cause you're my unforeseen 
And I hope that you'll be with me, 
if only in my dreams. 
But here you are next to me, 
and you're glad, or so it seems. 


And I don't know for shure 
where this is going. 
Still I hope for more, and more. 
'Cause who would know that you 
would treat me like a boy, 
and I treat you like a girl, 
in this funny little world. 


Don't promise me for ever, 
just love me day by day. 
No one knows the future, 
we're young, but that's OK. 
'Cause you'll allways be a part of me, 
whatever life will bring. 
And people have to bear with you, 
this silly song i sing. 


Your boyfriends might be angry, 
my girlfriends might be blue. 
But no one can deny it, 
from now on I love you. 
I have to say it's new to me, 
this feeling in my heart. 
Guess i've been kind of lonely, 
and you've been kind of smart. 


And I don't know for shure 
where this is going. 
Still I hope for more, and more. 
'Cause who would know that you 
would treat me like a boy, 
and I treat you like a girl, 
in this funny little world. 


And I don't know for shure 
where this is going. 
Still I hope for more, and more. 
'Cause who would know that you 
would treat me like a boy, 
and I treat you like a girl, 
in this funny little world.
