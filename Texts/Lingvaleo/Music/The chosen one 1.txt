Oh, it's bad luck to be you. 
A chosen one of many isn't new 
When you think you're full of luck 
in the bullock's you'll get struck 
Oh, it's bad luck to be you. 


Now, Ogan came young from the farm. 
And tried to save the princess from all harm. 
Equipped with just a stick 
And a head makde out of brick. 
His rabbit's foot failed as a charm. 


Oh, it's bad luck to be you. 
The prophecy is never coming true 
In a pickle you'll be stuck 
Like a chicken you'll cluck 
Oh, it's bad luck to be you. 


Believing that he was the one 
His Ego weighed in at a ton. 
His Mum's a crazy bat. 
Did we mention that she was fat. 
And she'll need a pine box for her son. 


Oh, it's bad luck to be you. 
Don't think for just a second it's not true 
When your life has run amuck 
You'll see that you're the schmuck. 
Oh, it's bad luck to be 
Really bad luck to be 
Nobody could disagree. 
It's a freaking guarantee. 
Oh, it's bad luck to be you. 
Diddly doo.
