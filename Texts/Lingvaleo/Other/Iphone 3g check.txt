What's great about the iPhone is that if you wanna check snow conditions on the mountain, there's an app for that. If you wanna check how many calories are in your lunch, there's an app for that. And if you wanna check where exactly you parked the car, there's even an app for that. 
Yup, there's an app for just about anything, only on the iPhone.
