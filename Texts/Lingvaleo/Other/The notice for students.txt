One day a professor could not stay for his afternoon classes, so he put a notice on the door, which read as follows: "Professor Evans will not be able to meet his classes this afternoon". 
Then he went to put on his coat and on his way out saw that some student had rubbed off the letter "c" in the word "classes" on the notice. The professor smiled and rubbed off the letter "l" in the word "lasses".
