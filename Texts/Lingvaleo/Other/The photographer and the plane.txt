A photographer from a well known national magazine was assigned to cover the fires at Yellowstone National Park. 
When the photographer arrived, he realized that the smoke was so thick that it would seriously impede or make it impossible for him to photograph anything from ground level. He requested permission to 
rent a plane and take photos from the air. 
He arrived at the airport and saw a plane warming up near the gate. 
He jumped in with his bag and shouted, "Let's go!'' The pilot swung the little plane into the wind, and within minutes they were in the air. 
The photographer said, "Fly over the park and make two or three low passes so I can take some pictures." 
"Why?" asked the pilot. "Because I am a photographer," he responded, "and photographers take photographs." 
The pilot was silent for a moment; finally he stammered, "You mean you're not the flight instructor?"
