A porter in a British hotel comes upon an American tourist impatiently jabbing at the button for the lift. 
"Sir, the lift will be here in a moment." 
"Lift? Lift?" replies the American. "Oh, you mean the elevator." 
"No sir, here we call it a lift." 
"Well, as it was invented in the United States, it's called an elevator." 
"Yes sir, but as the language was invented here, it's called a lift."
