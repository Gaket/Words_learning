A blonde woman boards an airplane. She is extremely exhausted and just wants to take a nap. She finally finds her seat and sits down next to a very curious young man. 


He wants to test the whole dub blonde thing and possibly make some money out of it. "Hey, wanna play a game?" he asks her. "No thank you, i just want to take a nap." "Please, its really easy, all you have to do is answer the questions that i ask you. If you don't know the answer, then you give me five dollars, and if I don't know the answer to your question, then I'll give you five dollars." 


"I really don't want to do this. I just want to take a nap." 


"Oh but PLEASE pretty please. Okay, how about if I don't know the answer to your question, I'll give you five hundred dollars." The blonde woman became interested and decided to play the game. 


"Okay. How many moons does jupiter have?" the young man asked. The woman reached into her purse and took out a five dollar bill. "What goes up the mountain with three legs and comes back down with four?" 


The young man, determined not to lose, gets out his laptop and searches all over the internet for an answered. Flustered and confused, the young man handed the blonde five hundred dollars. 


After a few hours, the young man was itching to know the answer to the question. "What was the answer to the riddle?" the blonde woman reached into her purse and handed the young man a five dollar bill.
