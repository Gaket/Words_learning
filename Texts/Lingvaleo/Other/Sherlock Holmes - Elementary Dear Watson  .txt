Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson go on a camping trip, set up their tent, and fall asleep. Some hours later, Holmes wakes his faithful friend. 


- Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see. 


Watson replies, - I see millions of stars. 


- What does that tell you? 


Watson ponders for a minute. 
- Astronomically speaking, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets. Astrologically, it tells me that Saturn is in Leo. Timewise, it appears to be approximately a quarter past three. Theologically, it's evident the Lord is all-powerful and we are small and insignificant. Meteorologically, it seems we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. What does it tell you? 


Holmes is silent for a moment, then speaks. 
- Watson, you're idiot, someone has stolen our tent.
