A woman got on a bus, holding a baby. 
The bus driver said, "That's the ugliest baby I have ever seen." 
The woman got angry but said nothing and went to the back of the bus. 
The man seated next to her felt that was angry, and asked her what wrong. 
"The bus driver insulted me," she said/ 
The man sympathized and said, "He's a public servant and shouldn't say things to insult passengers." 
You're right," she said. "I think I'll go back up there and give him a piece of my mind." 
"That's a good idea," the man said. "Here, let me hold your monkey."
