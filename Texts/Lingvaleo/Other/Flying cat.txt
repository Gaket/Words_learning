Once upon a time a priest had a cat. 
One day the priest found that his cat had disappeared. So he went out and on the tree next to his house he noticed the cat. 
Cat was in trouble. He couldn't come down the tree. So priest took the rope and linked it to the tree, another end of the rope he linked to the car. The idea was that car would lean the tree close to the the ground, so that cat could jump down. 
However the rope was not strong enough and snapped under the load. So the cat was shot like an arrow , and priest just saw it flying. 
But the story hasn't ended at that. 
Next door there lived a mum with little daughter. Little girl was fond of cats and she begged her mum to buy one. Meanwhile daughter reminded her mum about her wish. 
Mum found a good way out the situation. She said- if you were a good girl, and prayed to God, He would send one to you. 
Girl knelt and started to pray. Just a second later the cat flew inside the room... 


So, it doesn't matter where God takes His present from, what matters is how you get it
