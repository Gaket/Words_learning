An Arab student sends an e-mail 
to his dad, saying: 
Dear Dad 
Berlin is wonderful, 
people are nice and I really like it 
here, 
but Dad, I am a bit ashamed to 
arrive at my college with my 
pure-gold Ferrari 599GTB 
when all my teachers and many 
fellow students travel by train. 
Your son, 
Nasser 

The next day, 
Nasser gets a reply to his e-mail 
from his dad: 
My dear loving son 
Fifty million US Dollar has just 
been transferred to your 
account. 
Please stop embarrassing us. 
Go and get yourself a train too.
