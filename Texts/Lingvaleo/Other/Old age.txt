Bob, a 70-year-old, extremely wealthy widower, shows up at the Golf Club with a breathtakingly beautiful and very sexy 25-year-old blonde-haired woman who knocks everyone's socks off with her youthful sex appeal and charm as she hangs on Bob's arm, listening intently to his every word and laughing at all his jokes. 


His friends at the club are all aghast. At the very first chance, they corner him and ask, 'Bob, how'd you get the trophy girlfriend?' 


Bob replies, 'Girlfriend? She's my wife!' 


They are bowled over, but continue to ask: 'So, how'd you persuade her to marry you?' 


'I lied about my age', Bob replies. 


'What! Did you tell her you were only 50?' 


Bob smiles and says, 'No, I told her I was 90.'
