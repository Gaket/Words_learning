In Computer Heaven: 

The management is from Intel, 
The design and construction is done by Apple, 
The marketing is done by Microsoft, 
IBM provides the support, 
Gateway determines the pricing. 




In Computer Hell: 

The management is from Apple, 
Microsoft does design and construction, 
IBM handles the marketing, 
The support is from Gateway, 
Intel sets the price.
