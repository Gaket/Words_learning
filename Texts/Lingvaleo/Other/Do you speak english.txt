Excuse me. Excuse me. 
Sorry. Um, do you speak English? 
- No, I don't. Sorry. 
- Oh. 
My car's broken down, and i wondered if you could tell me where to find a garage. 


Well, that's wasted on me. 
I don't understand what you're saying. 


- You don't speak English at all? 
- Not a word, no. 
It's one of those things, I wish I'd paid attention in school. 


Excuse me. 
Do you speak any English?

- I don't know, I can't understand her. 


Hi. My car's broken down and I need to find a garage. 
No, I'm sorry. I didn't understand that at all. 


All right. Well, thanks. 


That way, about half a mile, there's a village. 
There might be somebody who speaks English. 


(Speaking German) 


- I'm sorry we couldn't be more help.

Next time you're over, maybe we'll have learnt English for you. 


Thanks anyway. 


- I can speak English. 
- So can I.
