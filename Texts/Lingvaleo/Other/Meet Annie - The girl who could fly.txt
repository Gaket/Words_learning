This is the story of a girl named Annie 
who dreamed she could fly. 
There were the doubters, the non-believers, 
the "no way you can do it"-ers. 
But like others that braved the sky before her, 
it took a mighty machine, 
brilliant ingenuity, 
and plain old stubbornness, to go where no fifth grader had gone before. 
And she flew, and she soared 
above the schoolyard and even that Eliza Jones, and beyond. 
My name is Annie and I'm the girl who dreamed she can fly.
