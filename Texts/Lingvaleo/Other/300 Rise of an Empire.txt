It begins as a whisper. A promise. The lightest of breezes dances above the death cries of 300 men. That breeze became a wind. A wind, my brothers, of sacrifice. A wind of freedom. A wind of justice. A wind of vengeance. 
Nothing will stop the march of my empire. 
I will attack the Greeks with my entire Navy. 
There will be death and destruction. 
Yes. There will be.
