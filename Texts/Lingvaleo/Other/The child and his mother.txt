A curious child asked his mother: "Mommy, why are some of your hairs turning grey?" 


The mother tried to use this occasion to teach her child: "It is because of you, dear. Every bad action of yours will turn one of my hairs grey!" 


The child replied innocently: "Now I know why grandmother has only grey hairs on her head."
