- This is it. 
- Let me give you one piece of advice. 
- Be honest. 
- He knows more than you can imagine. 
- At last. 
- Welcome, Neo. 
- As you no doubt have guessed I am Morpheus. 
- It's an honor to meet you. 
- No, the honor is mine. 
- Please, come. Sit. 
- I imagine that right now you're feeling a bit like Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole? 
- You could say that. 
- I can see it in your eyes. 
- You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he's expecting to wake up. 
- Ironically, this is not far from the truth. 
- Do you believe in fate, Neo? 
- No. - Why not? 
- Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life. 
- I know exactly what you mean. 
- Let me tell you why you're here. 
- You're here because you know something. 
- What you know, you can't explain. 
- But you feel it. You felt it your entire life. 
- Something's wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there. 
- Like a splinter in your mind driving you mad. 
- It is this feeling that has brought you to me. 
- Do you know what I'm talking about? 
- The Matrix? 
- Do you want to know what it is? 
- The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. 
- Even now, in this very room. 
- You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. 
- You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes. 
- It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. 
- What truth? - That you are a slave, Neo. 
- Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. 
- A prison for your mind. 
- Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. 
- You have to see it for yourself. 
- This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. 
- You take the blue pill the story ends; you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. 
- You take the red pill you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. 
- Remember all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more. Follow me.
