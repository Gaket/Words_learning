I'm not a star. I don't wanna be a star. I don't have a great name, the media have never heard of me. No public, no cheerleaders. It's not about winning or losing, it's about reaching your limits. Going as far as you can go and then going far of them. I don't collect titles, I collect hours, hours of hard work, hours of pain. As just me, I'm playing for the ultimate victory, the victory of yourself. 
This is a way of life, there's no finish line, becoming the best that you can be, there's nothing else that matters. Beating the odds, fulfilling your destiny. I don't wanna be a superstar, i want to be better than that, just want to be me, just wanna be ME.
