- One minute ... one minute please. Time ... thank you! 


Could you all please put down your pens and bring your papers to the front of the room? 


Thank you. Well done! Thank you ... Thank you ... Thank you. 
- Oh! I'm sorry you're too late. 
I gave you plenty of warnings about time. 
You've failed. Sorry. 


- Excuse me. Do you know who I am? 


- I have absolutely no idea.
