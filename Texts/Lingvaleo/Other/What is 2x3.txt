A little boy returned home from school and told his father that he 
had failed the maths test. 


His father asked him, "Why did you fail?" 


The boy replied, "The teacher asked me 'How much is 3 x 2?' and I said 
'3 x 2 is 6'." 


"Well, that's right" said his father. 


The little boy continued, "Then she asked me 'How much is 2 x 3?" 


"What the hell is the difference?" asked the father. 


The son replied, "That's exactly what I said to my teacher and that's 
why I failed the maths test.
