A plane is on its way to Houston when a blonde in Economy Class gets up and moves to the First Class section and sits down. 
The flight attendant watches her do this and asks to see her ticket. She then tells the blonde that she paid for Economy and that she will have to sit in the back. The blonde replies "I'm blonde, I'm beautiful, I'm going to Houston and I'm staying right here!" 
The flight attendant goes into the cockpit and tells the co-pilot that there is a blonde bimbo sitting in First Class who belongs in Economy and won't move back to her seat. The co-pilot goes back to the blonde and tries to explain that because she only paid for Economy she will have to leave and return to her seat. 
The blonde replies, "I'm blonde, I'm beautiful, I'm going to Houston and I'm staying right here!" 
The co-pilot tells the pilot that he probably should have the police waiting when they land to arrest this blonde woman who won't listen to reason. 
The pilot says "You say she's blonde? I'll handle this. I'm married to a blonde. I speak blonde." 
He goes back to the blonde, whispers in her ear, and she says "Oh, I'm Sorry, " and she gets up and moves back to her seat in the Economy section. 
The flight attendant and co-pilot are amazed and asked him what he said to make her move without any fuss. 
"I told her First Class isn't going to Houston.
