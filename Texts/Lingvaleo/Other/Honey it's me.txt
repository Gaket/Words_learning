Several men are in the locker room of a golf club. 


When a cell phone on a bench rings, a man engages the hands-free speaker function and begins to talk.... 


MAN: "Hello" 


WOMAN: "Honey, it's me. Are you at the club?" 


MAN: "Yes." 


WOMAN: I am at the mall and found a beautiful leather coat. It's $1,000. Can I buy it?" 


MAN: "OK, go ahead if you like it that much." 


WOMAN: I also stopped by the Mercedes dealership and saw the 2002 models. I saw one I really liked." 


MAN: How much?" 


WOMAN: $60,000. 


MAN: "For that price I want it with all the options." 


WOMAN: "Great! One more thing..... The house we wanted last year is back on the market. They're only asking $450,000." 


MAN: "Well, then go ahead and buy it but just offer $420,000." 


WOMAN: "OK. I'll see you later! I love you!" 


MAN: "Bye, I love you too." 


The man hangs up. The other men are looking at him in astonishment 


Then he asks: "Anyone know who this phone belongs to?"
