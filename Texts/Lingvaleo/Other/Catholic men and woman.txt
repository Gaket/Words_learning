Four Catholic men and a Catholic woman were having coffee in St. Peters Square. 
The first Catholic man tells his friends, "My son is a priest, when he walks into a room, everyone calls him 'Father'." 
The second Catholic man chirps, "My son is a Bishop. When he walks into a room people call him 'Your Grace'." 
The third Catholic gent says, "My son is a Cardinal. When he enters a room everyone bows their head and says 'Your Eminence'." 
The fourth Catholic man says very proudly, "My son is the Pope. When he walks into a room people call him 'Your Holiness'." 
Since the lone Catholic woman was sipping her coffee in silence, the four men give her a subtle, "Well .........?" 
She proudly replies, "I have a daughter, slim, tall, 38" DD bust, 24" waist and 34" hips. 
When she walks into a room, everybody says, "Oh My God."
