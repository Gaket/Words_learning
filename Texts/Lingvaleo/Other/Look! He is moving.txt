Three buddies die in a car crash, and they go to heaven to an orientation. 
They are all asked, "When you are in your casket and friends and family are mourning upon you, what would you like to hear them say about you?" 
The first guy says, "I would like to hear them say that I was a great doctor of my time, and a great family man." 
The second guy says, "I would like to hear that I was a wonderful husband and school teacher which made a huge difference in our children of tomorrow." 
The last guy replies, "I would like to hear them say, "Look! He's moving!"
