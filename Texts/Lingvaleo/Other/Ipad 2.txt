If you ask a parent, they might call it intuitive, 
if you ask a musician they might call it inspiring, 
to a doctor it's ground breaking, 
to a C.E.O. it's powerful, 
to a teacher it's the future. 
If you ask a child, she might call it: "Magic." 
And if you asked us, we'd say it's just getting started.
