When I was 14 years old, I dreamed, that some day I would have a girlfriend. In 16 years I got her, but there was no passion between us. 
Then I decided to marry a passionate girl. In the university I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Every trifle turned in a terrible drama and threatened her with suicide. 
I decided to marry a stable woman. By graduating from the university I met a very stable girl, but she turned out to be horribly boring. She was absolutely predictable and never lost her head. 
My life changed into routine, and I decided to marry a spice-girl. The spice-girl turned out to be too crazy. She constantly rushed from one extreme to another, was making me feel either happiest or unhappiest. She was super energetic, but without goals in life. 
I decided to marry the one who had ambitions in life. Then I found a clever, ambitious girl and married her. She was clever and ambitious to such extent, that she divorced with me after a year and obtained by court decision all that I had. 
Now I became wise, and I'm looking for a woman with big boobs...
