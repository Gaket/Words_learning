In the early 1930's, a farmer and his wife went to a fair. The farmer was fascinated by the airplanes and asked a pilot how much a ride would cost. 


'$10 for 3 minutes,' replied the pilot. 
'That's too much,' said the farmer. 


The pilot thought for a second and then said, 'I'll make you a deal. If you and your wife ride for 3 minutes without uttering a sound, the ride will be free. But if you make a sound, you'll have to pay $10.' 


The farmer and his wife agreed and went for a wild ride. After they landed, the pilot said to the farmer, 'I want to congratulate you for not making a sound. You are a brave man.' 


'Maybe so,' said the farmer, 'But I gotta tell ya, I almost screamed when my wife fell out.'
