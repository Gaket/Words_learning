Wife : Come help me plant my chillies. 
Husband : What do u think I am? A gardener? 
Wife : Come fix the toilet drain. 
Husband : What do u think I am? A plumber? 
Wife : Come fix the door handle.... 
Husband : What do u think I am? A carpenter? 
The husband went out... 
But when he came back, he saw that everything was fixed. The chilli garden, toilet drain & the door handle. 
He asked his wife who had done it? 
The wife said its the neighbour's son, but he gave me 2 options... Either to make him a burger or have sex with him... 
Husband: I'm sure, u gave him a burger! 

Wife : What do u think I am? Mc Donalds?
