Three friends were at the bar talking, and after many rounds of beer, one of them suggests that everyone admits something they have never admitted to anyone. 
"Okay," says the first, "I've never told anybody I'm a gay!" 
The second confesses, "I'm having an affair with my boss's wife." 
The third, Moishe, begins, "I don't know how to tell you..." 
"Don't be shy," the two friends said. 
"Well," says Moishe, "I can't keep secrets."
