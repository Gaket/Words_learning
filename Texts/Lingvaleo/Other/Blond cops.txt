A blonde cop stops blonde motorist and asks for her driving license. 


The Motorist scuffles around in her purse and can't find it. She says to the cop, "I must have left it at home officer." 


The cop says, "Well, do you have any kind of identification?" The motorist scuffles around in her purse again, and finds a pocket mirror. 


She looks at it and says to the cop, "All I have is this picture of myself." The cop says, "Let me see it, then." So the blonde motorist gives the mirror to the blonde cop, who looks at it, and replies, "Well, if I had known you were a police officer, I wouldn't have even pulled you over. You can go now."
