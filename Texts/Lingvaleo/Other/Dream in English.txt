There's a story about a teacher who told his students, You know you're making progress in English when you speak in English, think in English, and dream in English. 


One day a student came into the class very excited and said, "Teacher, Teacher, last night I dreamt in English." The teacher said, "That's wonderful. What did you dream about?" And the student said, "I don't know, it was in English."
