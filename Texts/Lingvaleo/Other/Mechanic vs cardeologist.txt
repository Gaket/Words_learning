A mechanic was removing a cylinder-head from the motor of a Harley motorcycle when he spotted a well-known cardiologist in his shop. The cardiologist was there waiting for the service manager to come take a look at his bike when the mechanic shouted across the garage "Hey Doc, want to take a look at this?" 


The cardiologist, a bit surprised, walked over to where the mechanic was working on the motorcycle. The mechanic straightened up, wiped his hands on a rag and said, "So Doc, look at this engine. I open its heart, take the valves out, repair any damage, and then put them back in, and when I finish, it works just like new. 


So how come I make $25,000 a year, a pretty small salary and you get $160,000 when you and I are doing basically the same work?" 


The cardiologist paused, smiled and leaned over, then whispered to the mechanic... 


"Try doing it with the engine running!"
