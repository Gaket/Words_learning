"Can you spare some change?" a beggar asks a passerby. 
"No, I know you're going to spend it all on vodka." 
"No, sir, I don't drink." 
"Then you'll gamble it away." 
"No, I don't gamble either, sir." 
"Well then, you're going to spend it on women." 
"No, sir, I don't spend money on women." 
"Okay," the passerby finally agrees, finally. "I'm going to give you 100 dollars, if you come with me. I want to show my wife an example of what can happen to a man who has no bad habits."
