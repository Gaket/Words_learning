One day a man goes to a pet shop to buy a parrot. The assistant takes the man to the parrot section and asks the man to choose one. The man asks, ''How much is the yellow one?'' 


The assistant says, ''$2000.'' The man is shocked and asks the assistant why it's so expensive. The assistant explains, ''This parrot is a very special one. He knows typewriting and can type really fast.'' 


''What about the green one?'' the man asks. 


The assistant says, ''He costs $5000 because he knows typewriting and can answer incoming telephone calls and takes notes.'' 


''What about the red one?'' the man asks. 


The assistant says, ''That one's $10,000.'' 


The man says, ''What does HE do?'' 


The assistant says, ''I don't know, but the other two call him boss.''
