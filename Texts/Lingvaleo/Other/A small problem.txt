A woman keeps asking her husband if her boobs are so small. '' Does this shirt make them look bigger? Does this one make them look smaller?'' she asks. 
The next day her husband buys her a mirror. Before bed, she always looks in the mirror and asks her husband, ''Does this shirt make them look bigger? Does this one make them look smaller?'' 


Finally he gets so annoyed that he says, ''I know how to make them larger!'' 


''How!?!?!?'' she asks. 


''Take a bunch of toilet paper and rub it in between your boobs.'' 


''Well how long does it take?'' she asks. 


''They should expand over the years,'' he answers. 


''How did you know that?'' she wonders. 


''I dunno, but it sure worked for your ass, didn't it?'''
